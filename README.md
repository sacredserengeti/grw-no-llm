### Configuration File

GRW supports a configuration file at `~/.config/grw/config.json` that can be used to persist settings:

```json
{
  "debug": false,
  "no_diff": false,
  "monitor_command": "git status --short",
  "monitor_interval": 5,
  "theme": "dark"
}
```

Or a minimal configuration with only some settings:

```json
{
  "debug": true,
  "theme": "light"
}
```

Configuration options:
- `debug` (boolean): Enable debug logging (optional, default: false)
- `no_diff` (boolean): Hide diff panel, show only file tree (optional, default: false)
- `hide_changed_files_pane` (boolean): Hide changed files pane, show only diff (optional, default: false)
- `monitor_command` (string): Command to run in monitor pane (optional)
- `monitor_interval` (number): Interval in seconds for monitor command refresh (optional)
- `theme` (string): Initial theme setting (light, dark, or custom) (optional)
- `custom_theme` (object): Custom theme color definitions (optional, see below)
- `commit_history_limit` (number): Maximum number of commits to load in commit picker (optional, default: 100)
- `summary_preload_enabled` (boolean): Enable automatic summary preloading (optional, default: true)
- `summary_preload_count` (number): Number of summaries to preload ahead (optional, default: 5)
- `llm` (object): LLM provider configuration (optional)
  - `provider` (string): LLM provider (e.g., "openai")
  - `model` (string): Default LLM model name
  - `summary_model` (string): Specific model for commit summaries (optional)
  - `advice_model` (string): Specific model for generating advice (optional)
  - `max_tokens` (number): Maximum number of tokens to send to LLM for both summary and advice generation (optional, default: 16000)
  - `api_key` (string): API key for the LLM provider
  - `base_url` (string): Base URL for the LLM provider

A full configuration with LLM settings and a custom theme might look like this:

```json
{
  "debug": false,
  "no_diff": false,
  "hide_changed_files_pane": false,
  "monitor_command": "git status --short",
  "monitor_interval": 5,
  "theme": "custom",
  "commit_history_limit": 150,
  "summary_preload_enabled": true,
  "summary_preload_count": 8,
  "llm": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "summary_model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "advice_model": "gpt-4-turbo",
    "max_tokens": 12000,
    "api_key": "your-api-key-here",
    "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1"
  },
  "custom_theme": {
    "background": "#1e1e2e",
    "foreground": "#cdd6f4",
    "primary": "#89b4fa",
    "secondary": "#f9e2af",
    "error": "#f38ba8",
    "highlight": "#585b70",
    "border": "#313244",
    "directory": "#a6e3a1",
    "added": "#a6e3a1",
    "removed": "#f38ba8",
    "unchanged": "#cdd6f4"
  }
}
```

Command line arguments override configuration file settings.

### Interface Layout

The application will:
1. Monitor the current git repository
2. Display changed files in a tree structure on the left
3. Show git diffs in the right panel (when visible)
4. Display repository information in the status bar (with automatic text wrapping)
5. Update automatically every 500ms

### Panel Modes

- **Default mode**: Shows both file tree (30%) and diff panel (70%)
- **No-diff mode**: Shows only file tree (100% width)
- **Help mode**: Shows help documentation in place of diff panel or full content area

### Theme System

GRW includes a flexible theme system with built-in light and dark modes, plus support for a user-defined custom theme.

- **Dark Theme**: The default theme, optimized for terminal use with dark backgrounds.
- **Light Theme**: A bright theme suitable for light terminal backgrounds or for better readability in bright environments.
- **Custom Theme**: Define your own color scheme in the configuration file for a personalized look.
- **Hotkey Toggle**: Use `Ctrl+t` to cycle through the available themes (light, dark, and custom if configured).
- **Persistent Setting**: Your theme preference can be saved in the configuration file or set via the command line.

The theme system intelligently adapts all UI components to the selected theme, ensuring that important information, like git diff colors (green for additions, red for deletions), remains clear and visible.

#### Custom Themes

You can create a custom theme by adding a `custom_theme` object to your `~/.config/grw/config.json` file. The application will load your custom colors and make the theme available in the theme cycle.

- **Hex Colors**: All colors must be provided as hex strings in either `#RRGGBB` or shorthand `#RGB` format.
- **Fallback**: If any color key is omitted from the `custom_theme` object, the application will use the color from the default dark theme as a fallback for that specific key.

Here are all the available keys for the `custom_theme` object:

| Key          | Description                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `background` | The main background color of the application.|
| `foreground` | The primary text color.                      |
| `primary`    | The color for interactive elements and titles.|
| `secondary`  | The color for secondary text and highlights. |
| `error`      | The color for error messages and deletions.  |
| `highlight`  | The background color for selected items.     |
| `border`     | The color of pane borders.                   |
| `directory`  | The color for directory names in the file tree.|
| `added`      | The color for added lines in the diff view.  |
| `removed`    | The color for removed lines in the diff view.|
| `unchanged`  | The color for unchanged lines in the diff view.|

To activate your custom theme, set `"theme": "custom"` in your `config.json`.

### Logging

The application includes comprehensive logging for troubleshooting and monitoring:

- **Log location**: `~/.local/state/grw/grw.log` (follows XDG Base Directory specification)
- **Default level**: INFO (normal operation information)
- **Debug level**: DEBUG (detailed performance and operation logs)

```bash
# Enable debug logging
grw --debug

# View log file
cat ~/.local/state/grw/grw.log

# Follow log file in real-time
tail -f ~/.local/state/grw/grw.log
```

Debug logs include:
- Performance metrics for git operations
- Render timing information
- File change detection details
- UI state changes

## Architecture

GRW uses a modern shared state architecture built on lock-free concurrent data structures from the `scc` crate. This design provides better performance and lower latency compared to traditional channel-based communication.

### Shared State Components

- **GitSharedState**: Manages repository data, commit cache, and file diffs using concurrent HashMap structures
- **LlmSharedState**: Handles LLM summary and advice caching with active task tracking
- **MonitorSharedState**: Stores monitor command output and timing information
- **SharedStateManager**: Central coordinator for all shared state components

### Key Benefits

- **Lock-free operations**: All data structures use atomic operations for thread-safe access
- **Better cache locality**: Shared memory reduces overhead compared to message passing
- **Direct access**: Main thread can read data directly without waiting for channel messages
- **Concurrent caching**: Multiple workers can update caches simultaneously without blocking

### Performance Characteristics

- Real-time git status updates with minimal overhead
- Efficient LLM summary caching and preloading
- Responsive UI updates through direct shared state access
- Automatic cleanup of stale tasks and cached data
